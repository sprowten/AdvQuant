# Learning-R
Hi there! While in my master's programming, I had the opportunity to advance my knowledge of data analytics by learning R (Programming Language). This course also allowed me to further practice my skills with various statistical analyses, including factor analysis, OLS regression, logistic binomial and polynomial regression. This respository is for the R exercises done by me throughout this course.
